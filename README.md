# AI-Based Classroom Engagement Nudger

A multimodal AI assistant that provides real-time feedback and "nudges" to teachers to help them gauge and improve student engagement.

## The Problem

[cite_start]In any classroomâ€”physical, hybrid, or virtualâ€”it's a significant challenge for educators to accurately gauge the engagement level of every student[cite: 80]. [cite_start]Teachers often rely on intuition, which can be misleading and may not capture the state of quieter students[cite: 81]. This information gap can lead to:
* [cite_start]**Missed Opportunities:** Bright but shy students may not get the encouragement they need[cite: 81].
* [cite_start]**Ineffective Pacing:** Lessons might be too fast for some or too slow for others[cite: 82].
* [cite_start]**Teacher Burnout:** The constant guesswork is emotionally taxing for educators[cite: 83].

## Our Solution

[cite_start]This platform acts as an objective partner for the teacher, providing a real-time, data-driven window into the classroom's engagement level[cite: 84]. [cite_start]By analyzing key visual and audio indicators, our tool translates complex classroom dynamics into simple, actionable insights without replacing the teacher's critical role[cite: 86, 89].

[cite_start]Our goal is to empower educators to do what they do best: inspire, connect, and unlock student potential[cite: 89, 90].

## Key Features

* [cite_start]ðŸŽ¥ **Real-Time Emotion Detection:** Uses the webcam to analyze student facial expressions (Happy, Sad, Neutral, Angry, etc.) to gauge the overall mood of the class.
* [cite_start]ðŸŽ¤ **Audio Analysis:** Monitors ambient classroom noise (Loud, Quiet) and analyzes the teacher's speech for tone and energy.
* [cite_start]ðŸ’¡ **Smart Nudging System:** Provides context-aware, three-tier alerts (good, warning, critical) to the teacher when engagement appears to be dropping.
* [cite_start]ðŸ“Š **Live Dashboard:** A simple web interface built with Flask that displays four key engagement metrics in real-time.
* ðŸ”’ **Privacy-First Design:** No video or audio is ever recorded or stored. [cite_start]The system processes data in real-time and only uses aggregated, anonymous metrics for analysis.

# AI-Based Classroom Engagement Nudger

A multimodal AI assistant that provides real-time feedback and "nudges" to teachers to help them gauge and improve student engagement.

## The Problem

In any classroomâ€”physical, hybrid, or virtualâ€”it's a significant challenge for educators to accurately gauge the engagement level of every student. Teachers often rely on intuition, which can be misleading and may not capture the state of quieter students. This information gap can lead to:
**Missed Opportunities:** Bright but shy students may not get the encouragement they need.
**Ineffective Pacing:** Lessons might be too fast for some or too slow for others.
**Teacher Burnout:** The constant guesswork is emotionally taxing for educators.

## Our Solution

This platform acts as an objective partner for the teacher, providing a real-time, data-driven window into the classroom's engagement level.
By analyzing key visual and audio indicators, our tool translates complex classroom dynamics into simple, actionable insights without replacing the teacher's critical role.

Our goal is to empower educators to do what they do best: inspire, connect, and unlock student potential.

## Key Features

* ðŸŽ¥ **Real-Time Emotion Detection:** Uses the webcam to analyze student facial expressions (Happy, Sad, Neutral, Angry, etc.) to gauge the overall mood of the class.
* ðŸŽ¤ **Audio Analysis:** Monitors ambient classroom noise (Loud, Quiet) and analyzes the teacher's speech for tone and energy.
* ðŸ’¡ **Smart Nudging System:** Provides context-aware, three-tier alerts (good, warning, critical) to the teacher when engagement appears to be dropping.
* ðŸ“Š **Live Dashboard:** A simple web interface built with Flask that displays four key engagement metrics in real-time.
* ðŸ”’ **Privacy-First Design:** No video or audio is ever recorded or stored. The system processes data in real-time and only uses aggregated, anonymous metrics for analysis.

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **AI / Machine Learning:** OpenCV, DeepFace
* **Frontend:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript
